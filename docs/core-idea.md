# RAG Studio - Project Idea

> **TL;DR**: An open-source testing platform to discover what RAG approach works best for YOUR corpus. Because every corpus is different.

---

## The Problem: Every Corpus Is A Black Box

You're building a RAG system. You read the tutorials. You copy the example code. You use the "recommended" settings:

```python
# Standard RAG setup from tutorial
chunk_size = 512  # Why? "It's common"
overlap = 50      # Why? "Seems reasonable"  
model = "ada-002" # Why? "Everyone uses it"
top_k = 5         # Why? "Default value"
```

You run it. It... works? Sort of? Maybe?

**But you have no idea if it's actually good.**

Questions haunt you:
- Is chunk size 512 optimal for MY documents?
- Would Cohere embeddings work better for MY use case?
- Should I use semantic chunking for MY content?
- Is 0.78 similarity score good or bad for MY corpus?
- **Am I leaving 30% performance on the table?**

You're flying blind. Making decisions on gut feeling.

**Because you have no way to TEST your corpus.**

## Why This Happens

### The Core Issue: Every Corpus Is Different

```
Legal contracts:
├─ Long, dense paragraphs
├─ Specific terminology
├─ Hierarchical structure
└─ Best with: Large chunks + semantic splitting

Customer support tickets:
├─ Short, fragmented text
├─ Casual language
├─ Question-answer pairs
└─ Best with: Small chunks + hybrid retrieval

Medical records:
├─ Mixed structured/unstructured
├─ Critical accuracy needs
├─ Domain-specific terms
└─ Best with: Metadata filtering + reranking

Code documentation:
├─ Clear code blocks
├─ Technical examples
├─ Hierarchical sections
└─ Best with: Recursive chunking + local embeddings
```

**What works for one corpus fails for another.**

But everyone uses the same "default" settings because:
1. ❌ No way to test different approaches
2. ❌ Testing requires hours of re-indexing
3. ❌ No baseline to compare against
4. ❌ No visibility into what's happening

**Result**: Suboptimal RAG systems everywhere.

---

## The Real Pain Point

This project exists because **I experienced this pain personally.**

I built a RAG system with ~200 advisor profiles and 50 initiative descriptions. The system worked, but I had zero confidence it was optimal.

Questions I couldn't answer:
- ✅ "Does my chunking strategy make sense for these profiles?"
- ✅ "Would a different embedding model improve results?"
- ✅ "Are my queries actually retrieving the right content?"
- ✅ "What am I doing wrong when results are bad?"

**I had no way to test.** So I shipped with "good enough" and hoped.

Then I realized: **If I struggled with this, everyone building RAG struggles with this.**

### Validation: The Problem Is Universal

**UC Berkeley Research (April 2025)**:
- Studied 12 RAG practitioners
- 71.3% of parameter changes require re-indexing
- Developers rated evaluation maturity at **2/10**
- Quote: *"Testing pipeline changes was half a day's work"*

**Microsoft Built Their Own Tool**:
- Created "RAG Experiment Accelerator"
- Why? *"Teams lack tooling for rapid experimentation"*
- Problem: *"This lack prolongs experimentation phase"*

**Jerry Liu (LlamaIndex Creator)**:
- Quote: *"Combinatorial explosion of parameters to tune"*
- *"Developers don't know which configurations work"*

**Community Feedback**:
- HN: *"Building good RAG is impossible to debug"*
- Reddit: *"RAG is a black box, no way to validate"*
- GitHub: 100+ issues requesting testing tools

---

## Why Existing Solutions Don't Solve This

### Problem 1: Tutorial Examples Are Generic

```python
# Every tutorial shows this
docs = load_documents()
chunks = chunk(docs, size=512)  # Magic number
embeddings = embed(chunks)       # Default model
```

**But**:
- Is 512 right for YOUR docs?
- Is that model right for YOUR domain?
- **No one knows. No one tests.**

### Problem 2: Testing Is Too Slow

```
Want to test chunk size 1024?
└─> Re-chunk all documents (2 hours)
    └─> Re-embed everything (2 hours)
        └─> Re-index vectors (30 min)
            └─> Test queries (15 min)

Total: ~5 hours per config test
```

**Result**: People test 1-2 configs maximum, then give up.

### Problem 3: No Comparison Framework

Even if you test multiple configs, how do you compare?
- Manually look at results? (subjective)
- Check metrics? (which metrics?)
- Trust your gut? (unreliable)

**No systematic way to know what works.**

### Problem 4: Evaluation ≠ Testing

Existing tools (RAGAS, DeepEval, Phoenix):
- Focus on **evaluating** production systems
- Not on **testing** approaches before building
- Still require re-indexing for each test
- Complex to set up

**They solve the wrong problem.**

## The Solution: A Testing Platform for YOUR Corpus

### Core Concept

**"Upload your corpus. Test different RAG approaches. See what works."**

Like:
- 🔦 **Lighthouse** → Test YOUR website
- 📬 **Postman** → Test YOUR API
- 🧪 **RAG Studio** → Test YOUR corpus

### How It Works

**1. Upload Your Corpus**
```
Drag & drop your documents:
├─ PDFs
├─ Text files
├─ Markdown
└─ Up to 100 docs for testing
```

**2. Analyze Your Data**
```
RAG Studio analyzes:
├─ Document lengths
├─ Structure patterns
├─ Language complexity
├─ Content types
└─ Suggests starting configs
```

**3. Define Test Configs**
```
Create multiple approaches to test:

Config A: "Small Chunks"
├─ Chunk size: 512
├─ Overlap: 50
├─ Model: OpenAI ada-002
└─ Retrieval: Dense

Config B: "Large Chunks"
├─ Chunk size: 1024
├─ Overlap: 100
├─ Model: OpenAI ada-002
└─ Retrieval: Dense

Config C: "Semantic"
├─ Strategy: Semantic chunking
├─ Model: Cohere v3
└─ Retrieval: Hybrid
```

**4. Pre-Compute (One Time)**
```
RAG Studio processes your corpus with ALL configs:
├─ Chunks documents
├─ Generates embeddings
├─ Stores with metadata
└─ Takes ~5 minutes (one time)
```

**5. Test Instantly**
```
Run YOUR queries:
"What are the eligibility criteria?"

Results from ALL configs instantly:
├─ Config A: Score 0.78, Latency 230ms
├─ Config B: Score 0.85, Latency 250ms ⭐
└─ Config C: Score 0.81, Latency 280ms

See retrieved chunks side-by-side
Compare quality visually
Understand WHY one config wins
```

**6. Iterate & Learn**
```
Found Config B works best?
├─ Create variant with different overlap
├─ Test again (instant)
├─ Refine until optimal
└─ Export winning config for production
```

### Technical Innovation

**PostgreSQL + pgvector + Metadata Filtering**

Instead of re-indexing for each config:

```sql
-- Store ALL configs in one database
CREATE TABLE chunks (
  config_id UUID,    -- Which config
  content TEXT,
  embedding vector,
  ...
);

-- Test specific config instantly
SELECT * FROM chunks 
WHERE config_id = 'config-b'
ORDER BY embedding <=> query_embedding;
```

**No re-indexing. Just filter by config_id.**

2. **Testing is too slow**
3. **No one validates before building**
4. **People ship suboptimal RAG systems**
5. **It doesn't have to be this way**

**This tool makes RAG testable.**

Stop guessing what works.
Start testing on YOUR corpus.

**Let's make RAG approachable.**
