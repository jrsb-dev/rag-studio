***Cat\'s Eye*** (also known as ***Stephen King\'s Cat\'s Eye***) is a
1985 American [anthology](anthology_film "anthology"){.wikilink} [horror
thriller film](horror_thriller_film "horror thriller film"){.wikilink}
directed by [Lewis Teague](Lewis_Teague "Lewis Teague"){.wikilink} and
written by [Stephen King](Stephen_King "Stephen King"){.wikilink}. It
comprises three stories: \"[Quitters,
Inc.](Quitters,_Inc. "Quitters, Inc."){.wikilink}\", \"[The
Ledge](The_Ledge_(short_story) "The Ledge"){.wikilink}\", and
\"General\". The first two are adaptations of short stories in King\'s
1978 *[Night Shift](Night_Shift_(book) "Night Shift"){.wikilink}*
collection, and the third is unique to the film. The cast includes [Drew
Barrymore](Drew_Barrymore "Drew Barrymore"){.wikilink}, [James
Woods](James_Woods "James Woods"){.wikilink}, [Alan
King](Alan_King "Alan King"){.wikilink}, [Robert
Hays](Robert_Hays "Robert Hays"){.wikilink} and [Candy
Clark](Candy_Clark "Candy Clark"){.wikilink}. The three stories are
connected by the presence of a traveling cat and Barrymore, both of whom
play incidental roles in the first two and major characters in the
third.

## Plot

A stray [tabby cat](tabby_cat "tabby cat"){.wikilink} hides from a dog
in a delivery truck, which drives to New York City. The cat sees the
disembodied image of a young girl pleading for help and is picked up by
a man.

### \"Quitters, Inc.\" {#quitters_inc.}

Dick Morrison is advised by a friend to join Quitters, Inc., an
Organization formed by a former mob group to quit his smoking habit. The
clinic supervisor Vinnie Donatti explains that the clinic has a 100%
success rate due to brutal methods: every time Dick smokes, ruthless
consequences will befall his loved ones.

Donatti demonstrates the first of these consequences on the cat which is
put in a cage and tormented with electric shocks coming from the floor.
He explains that if he smokes, his wife Cindy will be shocked in front
of him. For subsequent infractions, his daughter Alicia will be shocked,
then Cindy will be raped. Finally, Dick himself will be killed. He hides
the threats from his family. Threats that are serious as Dick suspects
he is being watched day and night.

During a traffic jam, Dick smokes after finding an old pack of
cigarettes and is caught. Before watching Cindy suffer in the electric
cage, Dick fights back and fails as the tomcat escapes. Dick tells Cindy
everything, and eventually quits smoking for good, but he has gained
weight due to quitting. Donatti sets a target weight for him and informs
that if it\'s not met that someone will cut off his wife\'s little
finger, which is also proved later not to be an idle threat as they had
done this before to the wife of his friend.

### \"The Ledge\" {#the_ledge}

The Tomcat travels to [Atlantic City, New
Jersey](Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey "Atlantic City, New Jersey"){.wikilink},
where it sees the same disembodied girl\'s image once again asking for
his help.

After a road incident the tomcat is taken to the home of Cressner, a
crime boss and casino owner who wagers on anything. Cressner has Johnny
Norris kidnapped for having an affair with his wife and blackmails him
into circumnavigating the exterior ledge of his penthouse. If he
succeeds, he will gift him with cash and his wife. If Norris refuses,
the police will arrest him for possession of drugs that have been
planted in his car.

Cressner taunts Norris through this ordeal by various means, and a
pigeon lands beside him and pecks at his foot. Norris eventually returns
to the penthouse. Cressner says that he will honor the bet: his butler
Albert removes the drugs, and presents him with a bag of cash and his
wife\'s head.

Norris attacks him, while the cat trips Albert who drops his gun. Norris
seizes the gun and kills Albert, then threatens Cressner. Norris forces
Cressner to circumnavigate the ledge next. The escaping cat watches as
Cressner is attacked by the pigeon, and falls to his death.

### \"General\"

The cat travels onward to [Wilmington, North
Carolina](Wilmington,_North_Carolina "Wilmington, North Carolina"){.wikilink};
there he is adopted by Amanda, the girl who was asking for his help
earlier. She names him General. Her mother dislikes cats and, despite
Amanda\'s protests, puts General outside at night.

Amanda is in mortal danger from a small, malevolent
[troll](troll "troll"){.wikilink} that has intruded into the house. That
night, the troll emerges via a hole in one of the walls in her room. The
troll slays Polly, Amanda\'s pet bird and then tries to supernaturally
steal Amanda\'s breath. General finds a way into the house and chases
the troll out, but not before it wounds General with its dagger. Amanda
and her parents discover the dead bird.

Amanda\'s mother is convinced that General killed Polly, and she takes
him to an animal shelter to be euthanized. That night, the troll returns
and uses a doorstop to wedge Amanda\'s door shut, before attempting to
steal her breath again. General escapes the shelter and rushes back to
save Amanda. He fights with the troll and kills it by sending it flying
into an electric fan.

After her parents break into the room, they discover parts of the
troll\'s corpse, as well as the tiny dagger and the hole in the wall
that the troll used. General is rewarded with a large fish, then climbs
onto bed with Amanda. She wakes up and cuddles him.

## Production

In 1978, producer [Milton
Subotsky](Milton_Subotsky "Milton Subotsky"){.wikilink} and his company
Sword & Sorcery Productions optioned the [Stephen
King](Stephen_King "Stephen King"){.wikilink} short stories *[Quitters,
Inc.](Quitters,_Inc. "Quitters, Inc."){.wikilink}*, *[The
Ledge](The_Ledge_(short_story) "The Ledge"){.wikilink}*, and *[Sometimes
They Come
Back](Sometimes_They_Come_Back "Sometimes They Come Back"){.wikilink}*
from collection *[Night
Shift](Night_Shift_(short_story_collection) "Night Shift"){.wikilink}*
with the intention of combining them into an anthology film titled
*Fright Night*. [^1] A screenplay was written by Edward and Valerie
Abraham and the film made it to pre-production, but after failing to
acquire financial backing Subotsky sold his options to [Dino De
Laurentiis](Dino_De_Laurentiis "Dino De Laurentiis"){.wikilink} with
Subotsky retaining a co-producer\'s credit as well as input on script,
casting, and editing.[^2] After being impressed with [Drew
Barrymore](Drew_Barrymore "Drew Barrymore"){.wikilink}\'s performance in
his production of
*[Firestarter](Firestarter_(1984_film) "Firestarter"){.wikilink}*, De
Laurentiis asked King to write a brand new story tailored specifically
for Barrymore, which would then be incorporated into a story with
*Quitters Inc.* and *The Ledge* and serving as the basis for *Cat\'s
Eye*.[^3]

## Release and reception {#release_and_reception}

*Cat\'s Eye* was released theatrically in the United States by
[MGM](MGM "MGM"){.wikilink} on April 12, 1985. It grossed \$13,086,298
at the domestic box office.[^4]

[Roger Ebert](Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert"){.wikilink} gave the film three
stars out of four and wrote, \"Stephen King seems to be working his way
through the reference books of human phobias, and \'Cat\'s Eye\' is one
of his most effective films.\"[^5] [Vincent
Canby](Vincent_Canby "Vincent Canby"){.wikilink} of *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "The New York Times"){.wikilink}* called the
film \"the best screen adaptation of any of King\'s work since Brian De
Palma\'s \'[Carrie](Carrie_(1976_film) "Carrie"){.wikilink}\'\" and
\"pop movie making of an extremely clever, stylish and satisfying
order.\"[^6] *[Variety](Variety_(magazine) "Variety"){.wikilink}* wrote,
\"The three stories just don\'t connect and efforts to join them never
work. However, an excellent roster of talent does try its best.\"[^7]
[Gene Siskel](Gene_Siskel "Gene Siskel"){.wikilink} of the *[Chicago
Tribune](Chicago_Tribune "Chicago Tribune"){.wikilink}* gave the film
two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that the opening story \"is
so funny and so fresh that it\'s a shock and a disappointment to see it
come to an end in a half-hour. The movie\'s second short story is as
dull as can be; No. 3 is kind of fun; so it all adds up to a
better-than-average entertainment that sags terribly in the
middle.\"[^8] [Kevin
Thomas](Kevin_Thomas_(film_critic) "Kevin Thomas"){.wikilink} of the
*[Los Angeles Times](Los_Angeles_Times "Los Angeles Times"){.wikilink}*
stated that \"the special effects are impeccable and Giorgio
Postiglione\'s production design meticulous and inspired. Yet it\'s the
well-drawn characters, plus the brisk, stylish direction of Teague and
superb camerawork of Cardiff, that make it work.\"[^9] [Paul
Attanasio](Paul_Attanasio "Paul Attanasio"){.wikilink} of *[The
Washington Post](The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post"){.wikilink}*
wrote that all the stories \"repeat the same formula,\" but the middle
one was \"the most fun, because of the presence of the peerless Kenneth
McMillan,\" who \"plays here with a good-humored burlesque that recalls
[Jackie Gleason](Jackie_Gleason "Jackie Gleason"){.wikilink}.\"[^10]
[Kim Newman](Kim_Newman "Kim Newman"){.wikilink} of *[The Monthly Film
Bulletin](The_Monthly_Film_Bulletin "The Monthly Film Bulletin"){.wikilink}*
thought the film \"would have been sub-standard even as one of the
formula [Amicus](Amicus_Productions "Amicus"){.wikilink} anthologies of
the 60s and 70s,\" adding, \"Despite a few good performances (James
Woods, Kenneth McMillan), the film, like
*[Creepshow](Creepshow "Creepshow"){.wikilink}* before it, is
continually let down by the weak punch lines King provides for his
promising anecdotes.\"[^11] On [Rotten
Tomatoes](Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"){.wikilink}, the film has a
70% rating based on 30 reviews. The critical consensus reads: \"An
effective if knowingly silly Stephen King anthology that combines comedy
and terror.\"[^12] On [Metacritic](Metacritic "Metacritic"){.wikilink}
the film has a score of 70% based on reviews from 12 critics.[^13]

[Neil Gaiman](Neil_Gaiman "Neil Gaiman"){.wikilink} reviewed *Cat\'s
Eye* for *[Imagine](Imagine_(game_magazine) "Imagine"){.wikilink}*
magazine, stating it was \"Funny, scary, and one of the best King movies
so far.\"[^14]

The film was released on VHS in 1985 by [Key
Video](Key_Video "Key Video"){.wikilink} and in 1987 by both VHS and
Laserdisc by [CBS/Fox Video](CBS/Fox_Video "CBS/Fox Video"){.wikilink},
and later on DVD by [Warner Home
Video](Warner_Home_Video "Warner Home Video"){.wikilink} in 2002, and on
Blu-ray in 2016.[^15]

## Awards

The film was nominated for the [International Fantasy Film
Award](International_Fantasy_Film_Award "International Fantasy Film Award"){.wikilink}
for Best Film in 1987. Drew Barrymore was nominated for the Young Artist
Award for Best Starring Performance by a Young Actress in a Motion
Picture in 1986.[^16]
