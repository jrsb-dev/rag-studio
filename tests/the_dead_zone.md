***The Dead Zone*** is a 1983 American [science
fiction](science_fiction_film "science fiction"){.wikilink} [thriller
film](thriller_film "thriller film"){.wikilink} directed by [David
Cronenberg](David_Cronenberg "David Cronenberg"){.wikilink}. The
screenplay, by [Jeffrey Boam](Jeffrey_Boam "Jeffrey Boam"){.wikilink},
is based on the 1979 [novel of the same
title](The_Dead_Zone_(novel) "novel of the same title"){.wikilink} by
[Stephen King](Stephen_King "Stephen King"){.wikilink}. The film stars
[Christopher
Walken](Christopher_Walken "Christopher Walken"){.wikilink}, [Brooke
Adams](Brooke_Adams_(actress) "Brooke Adams"){.wikilink}, [Tom
Skerritt](Tom_Skerritt "Tom Skerritt"){.wikilink}, [Herbert
Lom](Herbert_Lom "Herbert Lom"){.wikilink}, [Martin
Sheen](Martin_Sheen "Martin Sheen"){.wikilink}, [Anthony
Zerbe](Anthony_Zerbe "Anthony Zerbe"){.wikilink}, and [Colleen
Dewhurst](Colleen_Dewhurst "Colleen Dewhurst"){.wikilink}. Walken plays
a schoolteacher, [Johnny
Smith](Johnny_Smith_(Dead_Zone) "Johnny Smith"){.wikilink}, who awakens
from a coma to find he has psychic powers. The film received positive
reviews. The novel also inspired a television series of the [same
name](The_Dead_Zone_(TV_series) "same name"){.wikilink} in the early
2000s, starring [Anthony Michael
Hall](Anthony_Michael_Hall "Anthony Michael Hall"){.wikilink}, the pilot
episode of which borrowed some ideas and changes used in the 1983 film.

In the novel, the phrase \"dead zone\" refers to the part of Johnny\'s
brain that is irreparably damaged, resulting in his dormant psychic
potential awakening. When some information in Johnny\'s visions is
beyond his perception, he considers that information as existing \"in
the dead zone.\" In the film adaptation, the phrase \"dead zone\" is
that part of his psychic vision that is missing---a blank area that he
cannot see. This \"dead zone\" refers to an outcome that is not yet
determined, meaning Johnny can change the future.

## Plot

After having a headache following a ride on a roller coaster in [Castle
Rock](Castle_Rock_(Stephen_King) "Castle Rock"){.wikilink},
[Maine](Maine "Maine"){.wikilink}, schoolteacher Johnny Smith politely
declines when his girlfriend Sarah asks if he wants to spend the night
with her. As he drives home through stormy weather, he has a car
accident that leaves him in a coma. Awakening under the care of
neurologist Dr. Sam Weizak, Johnny learns that five years have passed,
and Sarah is now a married mother.

Johnny discovers that he has gained the ability to psychically see
aspects of people\'s lives (past, present, and future) through physical
contact. As he touches a nurse\'s hand, he sees her daughter trapped in
a fire. He also sees that Weizak\'s mother, long thought to have died
during [World War II](World_War_II "World War II"){.wikilink}, is still
alive, and how a pushy reporter\'s sister committed suicide, hinting at
abuse by his hand.

With physical therapy, Johnny relearns to walk but retains a limp and
must use a cane. Sarah reestablishes contact with him, but she is torn
between her love for him and her family. They eventually drift apart.

As news of his gift spreads, Sheriff George Bannerman from nearby Castle
Rock asks Johnny for help with a series of murders. At first Johnny
declines, but he eventually agrees to help. Through a vision at the
crime scene, he discovers that deputy Frank Dodd is the killer. Before
Bannerman can arrest him, Dodd commits suicide. Dodd\'s mother shoots
Johnny, before being killed by Bannerman.

Johnny moves to a different town and lives a more isolated life as he
grows physically weaker due to his psychic abilities. Despite Weizak\'s
concerns, Johnny refuses further treatment. He tutors children, working
from home. The wealthy Roger Stuart hires Johnny to tutor his son,
Chris. Through Stuart, Johnny meets Greg Stillson, a superficially
charismatic
[third-party](third_party_(politics) "third-party"){.wikilink} candidate
for the [United States
Senate](United_States_Senate "United States Senate"){.wikilink}, for
whom Sarah and her husband, Walt, volunteer. Stuart warns Johnny that
Stillson is dangerous.

Johnny receives a vision of Chris and two other boys drowning in a local
pond during an ice hockey game. He implores Stuart to change his plans,
but he refuses and fires Johnny. Chris, however, stays home and lives,
while the two other boys drown. Johnny realizes he has a \"dead zone\"
in his visions, where the future is changeable.

At a political rally, Johnny shakes Stillson\'s hand and has a vision of
Stillson as
[President](President_of_the_United_States "President"){.wikilink}
ordering a [pre-emptive nuclear
strike](pre-emptive_nuclear_strike "pre-emptive nuclear strike"){.wikilink}.
Johnny seeks out Weizak\'s advice, asking, for instance, if he would
have killed [Adolf Hitler](Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler"){.wikilink} if he
had the chance, knowing beforehand the atrocities Hitler would commit.
Weizak replies that he would have had no choice but to kill him. Johnny
leaves Sarah a letter, telling her that what he is about to do will cost
him his life, but is a worthwhile sacrifice.

Sarah and her family attend a rally for Stillson. Johnny also sneaks in
with a rifle; he shoots at Stillson but misses. In the ensuing
commotion, Stillson grabs Sarah\'s baby and holds him as a human shield,
which a photographer captures on film. Before Johnny can fire again, he
is shot by Stillson\'s bodyguard. Johnny touches Stillson\'s hand and
foresees that, after the photograph is published, Stillson\'s career
ends in disgrace and he commits suicide, thus averting the nuclear
attack. Johnny lies dying as Sarah embraces him and tells him that she
loves him.

## Production

### Development

![*The Dead Zone* was initially under production by [Lorimar Film
Entertainment](Lorimar_Television "Lorimar Film Entertainment"){.wikilink}](Normal_lorimar_78.jpg "The Dead Zone was initially under production by Lorimar Film Entertainment")

After King\'s novel *The Dead Zone* was released in 1979, [Lorimar Film
Entertainment](Lorimar_Film_Entertainment "Lorimar Film Entertainment"){.wikilink}
began developing a film adaptation. Producer Carol Baum gave the book to
screenwriter [Jeffrey Boam](Jeffrey_Boam "Jeffrey Boam"){.wikilink} and
asked him to write a screenplay. \"I saw it had great possibilities and
agreed to do it,\" Boam said.[^1] He developed a script with director
[Stanley Donen](Stanley_Donen "Stanley Donen"){.wikilink}, who left the
project before the film had reached production at
Lorimar.[^2]`{{sfn|Rodley|1997|p=109}}`{=mediawiki} Boam completed his
first draft for the film on the same day as [Ronald
Reagan](Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan"){.wikilink}\'s
[election](1980_United_States_presidential_election "election"){.wikilink}
as president.`{{sfn|Rodley|1997|p=113}}`{=mediawiki}

Lorimar eventually closed its film division after a series of box-office
failures, and soon after, producer [Dino De
Laurentiis](Dino_De_Laurentiis "Dino De Laurentiis"){.wikilink} bought
the rights to *The Dead Zone*. He initially disliked Boam\'s screenplay
and asked King to adapt his own
novel.[^3][^4]`{{sfn|Rodley|1997|p=114}}`{=mediawiki} De Laurentiis then
reportedly rejected King\'s script as \"involved and convoluted\";[^5]
however, [David
Cronenberg](David_Cronenberg "David Cronenberg"){.wikilink}, who
ultimately directed the film, said that he was the one who decided not
to use the script, finding it \"needlessly brutal\".[^6] De Laurentiis
commissioned another script from [Andrzej
Żuławski](Andrzej_Żuławski "Andrzej Żuławski"){.wikilink}, but rejected
it and returned to Boam. Cronenberg later questioned the quality of the
script De Laurentiis read as it was initially written in Polish,
translated to English, and then translated to
Italian.[^7]`{{sfn|Rodley|1997|p=114}}`{=mediawiki} The film was finally
on track to be made when De Laurentiis hired producer [Debra
Hill](Debra_Hill "Debra Hill"){.wikilink} to work with Cronenberg and
Boam.[^8]

Cronenberg initially rejected De Laurentiis\' offer to direct the film,
but accepted the position after meeting
Hill.`{{sfn|Cronenberg|2006|p=72-73}}`{=mediawiki}`{{sfn|Rodley|1997|p=110}}`{=mediawiki}
Cronenberg received five scripts for the film, including one from King
which he described as \"the worst one by far\". Although Cronenberg did
not write *[Fast
Company](Fast_Company_(1979_film) "Fast Company"){.wikilink}* he was
involved in the writing process and made edits during filming. *The Dead
Zone* was his first film in which he did not have any involvement in
writing the script. It was also his first film that did not have any
Canadian content.`{{sfn|Cronenberg|2006|p=74}}`{=mediawiki}

![Film producer [Dino De
Laurentiis](Dino_De_Laurentiis "Dino De Laurentiis"){.wikilink}
purchased the rights to *The Dead Zone* after Lorimar\'s failed attempt
to produce the
film.](Dino_de_laurentiis_crop.jpg "Film producer Dino De Laurentiis purchased the rights to The Dead Zone after Lorimar's failed attempt to produce the film.")
Boam abandoned King\'s parallel story structure for *The Dead
Zone*{{\'}}s screenplay, turning the plot into separate episodes. Boam
told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, \"King\'s book is longer than it needed
to be. The novel sprawls and it\'s episodic. What I did was *use* that
episodic quality, because I saw *The Dead Zone* as a triptych.\"[^9] His
script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who
eliminated large portions of the novel\'s story,[^10] including plot
points about Johnny Smith having a brain
tumor.[^11]`{{sfn|Rodley|1997|p=114}}`{=mediawiki}

Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay
page by page. Boam\'s \"triptych\" in the screenplay surrounds three
acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after
he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff in
tracking down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to
confront the politician Stillson. Boam said he enjoyed writing character
development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of
his psychic abilities, and ultimately giving up his life for the greater
good. \"It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly
enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of
exploitation,\" he said. In Boam\'s first draft of the screenplay,
Johnny does not die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle
Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg
insisted that this \"trick ending\" be revised. Boam submitted the final
draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.[^12]

Boam stated that Donen wanted the film to be told from an outside point
of view while Cronenberg wanted it from Johnny\'s
perspective.`{{sfn|Rodley|1997|p=114}}`{=mediawiki} King is reported to
have told Cronenberg that the changes the director and Boam made to the
story \"improved and intensified the power of the narrative.\"[^13]

Before Christopher Walken was cast as Johnny Smith, [Bill
Murray](Bill_Murray "Bill Murray"){.wikilink} was considered for the
role[^14] as it was King\'s first choice.[^15] Cronenberg initially
wanted Nicholas Campbell to portray Johnny, but the director wound up
casting him as the Castle Rock Killer instead.[^16] Cronenberg also
wanted [Hal Holbrook](Hal_Holbrook "Hal Holbrook"){.wikilink} to portray
Sheriff Bannerman but De Laurentiis objected.[^17]

In addition to Donen, both [John
Badham](John_Badham "John Badham"){.wikilink} and [Michael
Cimino](Michael_Cimino "Michael Cimino"){.wikilink} were also considered
to direct.[^18]

### Filming

The financial failure of
*[Videodrome](Videodrome "Videodrome"){.wikilink}* occurred during the
filming of *The Dead Zone*.`{{sfn|Rodley|1997|p=102}}`{=mediawiki}
Shooting started in early January 1983[^19] and took place in the
[Greater Toronto
Area](Greater_Toronto_Area "Greater Toronto Area"){.wikilink} and the
[Regional Municipality of
Niagara](Regional_Municipality_of_Niagara "Regional Municipality of Niagara"){.wikilink}
of Cronenberg\'s native [Ontario](Ontario "Ontario"){.wikilink}, Canada.
The so-called [Screaming
Tunnel](Screaming_Tunnel "Screaming Tunnel"){.wikilink}, located in
nearby [Niagara Falls,
Ontario](Niagara_Falls,_Ontario "Niagara Falls, Ontario"){.wikilink},
was also used as the backdrop for the scene in which Johnny first helps
Bannerman and Dodd. The [gazebo](gazebo "gazebo"){.wikilink} was built
by the film crew and donated to
[Niagara-on-the-Lake](Niagara-on-the-Lake "Niagara-on-the-Lake"){.wikilink}.[^20]
It was Cronenberg\'s first film to utilize [stereophonic
sound](stereophonic_sound "stereophonic sound"){.wikilink}.`{{sfn|Cronenberg|2006|p=78}}`{=mediawiki}

According to a David Cronenberg interview on the DVD, *The Dead Zone*
was filmed during a relentless deep freeze in southern Ontario, which
lasted for weeks, creating an authentic atmosphere of subzero
temperatures and icy, snow-packed terrain, which made for great natural
shooting locations, despite it being almost too cold for cast and crew
to tolerate at times. [Canada\'s
Wonderland](Canada's_Wonderland "Canada's Wonderland"){.wikilink}, a
theme park 30 km north of [Toronto](Toronto "Toronto"){.wikilink}\'s
city limits, was also used as a filming location.

### Music

The music soundtrack, composed by [Michael
Kamen](Michael_Kamen "Michael Kamen"){.wikilink}, was recorded by the
[National Philharmonic
Orchestra](National_Philharmonic_Orchestra "National Philharmonic Orchestra"){.wikilink},
[London](London "London"){.wikilink}, at the famous EMI [Abbey Road
Studios](Abbey_Road_Studios "Abbey Road Studios"){.wikilink}. Michael
Kamen conducted the recording sessions; the orchestra was contracted and
led by [Sidney Sax](Sidney_Sax "Sidney Sax"){.wikilink}. This is the
only Cronenberg film since *[The
Brood](The_Brood "The Brood"){.wikilink}* (1979) for which [Howard
Shore](Howard_Shore "Howard Shore"){.wikilink} was not composer.

## Release

The film\'s premiere was planned for the [Toronto International Film
Festival](Toronto_International_Film_Festival "Toronto International Film Festival"){.wikilink},
but three days before the showing Paramount removed it as the studio did
not want negative reviews six weeks before the film\'s theatrical
release. *[Daniel](Daniel_(1983_film) "Daniel"){.wikilink}* was
premiered instead.`{{sfn|Knelman|1987|p=32-33}}`{=mediawiki}

Cronenberg criticized the film\'s theatrical distribution and stated
that it could have been number one at the box office had its
distribution been better.`{{sfn|Cronenberg|2006|p=62}}`{=mediawiki} The
head of marketing at Paramount, David Rose, was arrested for embezzling
money and Cronenberg theorized that Rose might have taken money meant
for the marketing of the film.`{{sfn|Cronenberg|2006|p=77}}`{=mediawiki}

Cronenberg showed his own Dolby stereo version of the film in Toronto
for a month as none of the theaters were playing that version and broke
even without concessions.`{{sfn|Rodley|1997|p=116}}`{=mediawiki}

## Reception

*The Dead Zone* received very positive reviews on release.[^21] It holds
an approval rating of 89% on [review
aggregator](review_aggregator "review aggregator"){.wikilink} website
[Rotten Tomatoes](Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"){.wikilink} based on
54 reviews, with an average score of 7.7/10. The site\'s consensus
reads, \"*The Dead Zone* combines taut direction from David Cronenberg
and a rich performance from Christopher Walken to create one of the
strongest Stephen King adaptations.\"[^22] On
[Metacritic](Metacritic "Metacritic"){.wikilink}, the film has a score
of 69 out of 100 based on 8 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable
reviews\".[^23]

[Roger Ebert](Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert"){.wikilink} of the *[Chicago
Sun-Times](Chicago_Sun-Times "Chicago Sun-Times"){.wikilink}* gave the
film three-and-a-half stars, describing *The Dead Zone* as by far the
best of the half-a-dozen cinematic adaptations of King\'s novels to that
date. He praised Cronenberg\'s direction for successfully weaving the
supernatural into the everyday, and noted believable performances by the
entire cast, especially Walken: \"Walken does such a good job of
portraying Johnny Smith, the man with the strange gift, that we forget
this is science fiction or fantasy or whatever and just accept it as
this guy\'s story.\"[^24] [Janet
Maslin](Janet_Maslin "Janet Maslin"){.wikilink} of *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "The New York Times"){.wikilink}* referred to
the film as \"a well-acted drama more eerie than terrifying, more rooted
in the occult than in sheer horror.\"[^25] [Robin
Wood](Robin_Wood_(critic) "Robin Wood"){.wikilink} stated that it was
the first film by Cronenberg that he could admire and called it a
\"healthy development\".`{{sfn|Rodley|1997|p=118}}`{=mediawiki}

[Dave Kehr](Dave_Kehr "Dave Kehr"){.wikilink} of the *[Chicago
Reader](Chicago_Reader "Chicago Reader"){.wikilink}* was more critical
of the film, describing it as \"By no means a bad film, just a
disappointingly bland and superficial one \... in which director David
Cronenberg relinquishes the one thing that had always set him apart from
his Canadian colleagues: his willingness to follow his intuitions rather
than the logic of a script.\"[^26]

### Box office {#box_office}

The film grossed \$20.8 million in the United States and Canada).[^27]
Worldwide, it earned [theatrical
rentals](theatrical_rental "theatrical rental"){.wikilink} of \$16.3
million.[^28]
