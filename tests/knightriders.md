***Knightriders*** is a 1981 American [action drama
film](Drama_(film_and_television)#Action_drama "action drama film"){.wikilink}
written and directed by [George A.
Romero](George_A._Romero "George A. Romero"){.wikilink} and starring [Ed
Harris](Ed_Harris "Ed Harris"){.wikilink}, Gary Lahti, [Tom
Savini](Tom_Savini "Tom Savini"){.wikilink}, Amy Ingersoll, [Patricia
Tallman](Patricia_Tallman "Patricia Tallman"){.wikilink}, and [Christine
Forrest](Christine_Forrest "Christine Forrest"){.wikilink}. It was
filmed entirely on location in the
[Pittsburgh](Pittsburgh "Pittsburgh"){.wikilink} metro area, including
[Fawn
Township](Fawn_Township,_Allegheny_County,_Pennsylvania "Fawn Township"){.wikilink}
and [Natrona](Natrona,_Pennsylvania "Natrona"){.wikilink} during the
summer of 1980.[^1]

The film represents a change of pace for Romero, known primarily for his
[horror films](horror_film "horror film"){.wikilink}; it is a personal
drama about a traveling [renaissance
fair](renaissance_fair "renaissance fair"){.wikilink} troupe.[^2]

## Plot

Billy leads a traveling troupe that
[jousts](Jousting "jousts"){.wikilink} on motorcycles. \"King William\",
as he styles himself, tries to lead the troupe according to his
[Arthurian](Arthurian "Arthurian"){.wikilink} ideals, but the pressure
of balancing those ideals against modern day realities and the financial
burden of running the organization are beginning to strain the group.
Billy is also plagued by a recurring dream of a black bird. Tensions are
exacerbated by Billy constantly pushing himself despite being injured
and the arrival of a promoter named Bontempi, who wants to represent the
troupe.

After Billy spends a night in jail watching a member of his troupe being
beaten because Billy has refused a payoff to a corrupt local cop, he
returns to the fairground where the troupe is next to perform. He is
shocked that some members want to join the promoter. His sense of
betrayal is heightened when his queen, Linet, admits that her feelings
for him may not be the reason she remains with the troupe.

Things come to a head after Morgan, leader of the dissident faction who
believes he should be king, wins the day\'s tournament and a fight
breaks out between the troupe and rowdy members of the crowd. Billy
faces an Indian rider with a black eagle crest on his breast plate, the
black bird of his dreams. Billy defeats the Indian but aggravates his
injury; later he commissions the Indian as a knight in his troupe.
Morgan and several other riders leave the troupe to follow Bontempi.
Billy\'s loyal supporter Alan also departs with his new girlfriend Julie
and friend Bors to try to sort out his emotions. Billy and the remainder
of the troupe settle at the fairground to await the dissidents\' return.

Troupe member Pippin comes to terms with his
[homosexuality](homosexuality "homosexuality"){.wikilink} and finds love
with Punch. Alan\'s girlfriend, Julie, has run away from home to escape
her alcoholic and abusive father and her weak-willed mother. While Alan
is soul searching, he realizes Julie is using him as an escape and that
he really desires Billy\'s Queen Linet. Alan takes a confused and hurt
Julie home to her parents.

Meanwhile, Morgan\'s riders succumb to infighting. Alan finds Morgan and
helps him realize that there can only be one king and he sees about
signing with Bontempi. However, after seeing rowdy drunken behavior in
his friends, Morgan and his riders return to Billy\'s fair to challenge
for the crown. Billy announces his retirement and sets forth the rules:
all knights compete, and any man knocked off his motorcycle is out.
Morgan is victorious, and is crowned king by Billy. Angie, the troupe\'s
mechanic, is then crowned queen by Morgan, after he realizes she is the
woman he loves. Linet finds love with Alan.

Billy leaves the troupe, accompanied by the silent eagle-crested knight,
and returns to thrash the crooked cop. While riding again, Billy, weak
and hallucinatory from loss of blood from his injury, has a vision of
riding an actual horse. Immediately afterwards he is struck by an
oncoming truck. The entire troupe gathers at Billy\'s funeral to say
farewell to its fallen king.

## Production

[Montes-Bradley](Eduardo_Montes-Bradley "Montes-Bradley"){.wikilink}.](George_Romero_Directing.jpg "George Romero on the set of Knightriders. Photo by Montes-Bradley."){width="250"}
A labor of love,[^3] the film was initially conceived as a proper period
piece which would portray the [Middle
Ages](Middle_Ages "Middle Ages"){.wikilink} in a more realistic
fashion.[^4] It was rethought after Romero\'s experience working on
racing documentaries.[^5]

Romero has claimed the medieval hobbyist organization, the [Society for
Creative
Anachronism](Society_for_Creative_Anachronism "Society for Creative Anachronism"){.wikilink},
to be one inspiration for the film.[^6] It was the first of three films
financed and released through United Film Distribution.[^7]

A shorter cut of the film (running 102 minutes) was released in Europe.
In the movie\'s credits, the writer Stephen King is referred to as
\"Hoagie man,\" as he makes a few sarcastic comments during the
troupe\'s first performance while munching on a large sandwich.

## Critical reception {#critical_reception}

Christopher John reviewed *Knightriders* in *[Ares
Magazine](Ares_(magazine) "Ares Magazine"){.wikilink}* #9 and commented
that \"\[with\] the exceptional soundtrack, excellent photography, sharp
writing, directing and editing, let alone the performances of a well
trained cast, it is worth the time and effort to see *Knightriders*. It
is the best movie of 1981 so far.\"[^8] Tony Williams, in his book *The
Cinema of George A. Romero*, said \"Knightriders is a highly personal
and sincere film revealing Romero\'s Utopian ideals in a cinematically
allegorical manner. Although flawed by its long running time and some
over-emphatic dialogue scenes, it is nonetheless one of the director\'s
major achievements which deserves better recognition.\"[^9] On review
aggregator [Rotten
Tomatoes](Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"){.wikilink}, *Knightriders*
holds an approval rating of 80%, based on 15 reviews, and an average
rating of 6.2/10.[^10]

## Soundtrack

The [film score](film_score "film score"){.wikilink} by [Donald
Rubinstein](Donald_Rubinstein "Donald Rubinstein"){.wikilink} was
released on [Perseverance
Records](Perseverance_Records "Perseverance Records"){.wikilink} in
2008.
