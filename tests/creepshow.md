	comedy](horror_comedy "horror comedy"){.wikilink} [anthology
	film](anthology_film "anthology film"){.wikilink} directed by [George A.
	Romero](George_A._Romero "George A. Romero"){.wikilink} and written by
	[Stephen King](Stephen_King "Stephen King"){.wikilink} in his
	screenwriting debut. It consists of five segments intercut with a sixth
	story acting mostly as an opening and epilogue; two of the segments,
	\"[The Lonesome Death of Jordy
	Verrill](Weeds_(short_story) "The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill"){.wikilink}\"
	and \"[The Crate](The_Crate "The Crate"){.wikilink}\", are based on
	stories by King, while the others are original material he wrote for the
	film.

The film stars an [ensemble
cast](ensemble_cast "ensemble cast"){.wikilink} including [Hal
Holbrook](Hal_Holbrook "Hal Holbrook"){.wikilink}, [Adrienne
Barbeau](Adrienne_Barbeau "Adrienne Barbeau"){.wikilink}, [Fritz

Danson](Ted_Danson "Ted Danson"){.wikilink} and [Ed
Harris](Ed_Harris "Ed Harris"){.wikilink}, with King and his son
[Joe](Joe_Hill_(writer) "Joe"){.wikilink} portraying the respective main
characters of two segments. It was primarily shot on location in
[Pittsburgh](Pittsburgh "Pittsburgh"){.wikilink} and its suburbs,
including Monroeville, where Romero leased an old boys\' academy (Penn
Hall) to build extensive sets for the film. *Creepshow* is an
[homage](Homage_(arts) "homage"){.wikilink} to the
[EC](EC_Comics "EC"){.wikilink} horror comics of the 1950s, such as
*[Tales from the
Crypt](Tales_from_the_Crypt_(comics) "Tales from the Crypt"){.wikilink}*,
*[The Vault of
Horror](The_Vault_of_Horror_(comics) "The Vault of Horror"){.wikilink}*
and *[The Haunt of
Fear](The_Haunt_of_Fear "The Haunt of Fear"){.wikilink}*. In order for
the film to give viewers a comic book feel, Romero hired long-time
effects specialist [Tom Savini](Tom_Savini "Tom Savini"){.wikilink} to
replicate comic-like effects.

The film earned \$21 million in the United States.[^1] It was followed
by a [sequel](sequel "sequel"){.wikilink}, *[Creepshow
2](Creepshow_2 "Creepshow 2"){.wikilink}* (1987), directed by the first
film\'s cinematographer [Michael
Gornick](:it:Michael_Gornick "Michael Gornick"){.wikilink}, written by
Romero and only featuring segments based on King stories. Two further
works in the franchise were made without involvement from either Romero
or King: the film *[Creepshow 3](Creepshow_3 "Creepshow 3"){.wikilink}*
(2006) and an [eponymous television
series](Creepshow_(TV_series) "eponymous television series"){.wikilink}
(2019--2023).

## Plot

### Prologue

Billy Hopkins, a young boy, gets disciplined by his abusive father Stan
for reading *Creepshow*, a horror comic. Not wanting his son to be
exposed to the comic\'s content, Stan throws it in the garbage. As Billy
sits upstairs, wishing that his father rots in
[Hell](Hell "Hell"){.wikilink}, he hears a sound at the window.

The source of the noise turns out to be the Creep, the host of the comic
book, who beckons him to come closer and removes the trash can\'s lid.

### \"Father\'s Day\" {#fathers_day}

Sylvia Grantham meets her nephew Richard and niece Cass, along with
Cass\'s new husband Hank Blaine at the Grantham estate for the family\'s
annual dinner on the third Sunday in June. They proceed to tell Hank
about the family [matriarch](Matriarchy "matriarch"){.wikilink}, Great
Aunt Bedelia, and of how it is an [open
secret](open_secret "open secret"){.wikilink} in the family that she
murdered her late father: the miserly and domineering Nathan Grantham
who had accumulated the family\'s fortune through
[bootlegging](Rum-running "bootlegging"){.wikilink},
[fraud](fraud "fraud"){.wikilink},
[extortion](extortion "extortion"){.wikilink}, and
[murder-for-hire](Contract_killing "murder-for-hire"){.wikilink}.

Many years earlier, Bedelia was rendered an unstable
[spinster](spinster "spinster"){.wikilink}, the result of a lifetime
spent putting up with her father\'s incessant demands and [emotional
abuse](emotional_abuse "emotional abuse"){.wikilink}, which got even
worse after he suffered a [stroke](stroke "stroke"){.wikilink} and she
was made to nurse him full-time. The torture culminated with Nathan
orchestrating a fatal \"hunting accident\", which took the life of his
daughter\'s fianc√© Peter Yarbro, in order to keep her under his thumb.
That [Father\'s Day](Father's_Day "Father's Day"){.wikilink}, Bedelia,
driven into a murderous rage by Nathan\'s constant insults and his
petulant demands for his cake, bashed her overbearing father\'s head in
with a marble ashtray (which is hidden throughout the other stories).

In the present day, Bedelia arrives at Grantham Manor that evening. She
stops by the family cemetery, just outside the mansion, to lay a flower
at her father\'s grave. She drunkenly reminisces about the murder, and
reveals that Sylvia staged the killing as an accident in order to steal
and distribute Nathan\'s fortune among the rest of the family. She
accidentally spills her [whiskey](Whisky "whiskey"){.wikilink} bottle in
front of the [headstone](headstone "headstone"){.wikilink}. Just then,
Nathan\'s reanimated, putrefied, maggot-infested corpse emerges from the
burial plot, still demanding the Father\'s Day cake he never got. He
avenges himself on Bedelia, strangling her. He proceeds to
systematically wipe out the rest of his family: telekinetically crushing
Hank to death with a gravestone, then twisting Sylvia\'s neck; he also
kills Mrs. Danvers, the Granthams\'
[cook](Cook_(domestic_worker) "cook"){.wikilink}, possibly to cover his
tracks. As a gruesome final joke, Nathan surprises Cass and Richard by
presenting them with his Father\'s Day cake: Sylvia\'s severed head,
covered with frosting and lit candles.

While the ending is left ambiguous in the film, with Nathan gloating
over a terrified Cass and Richard in
[freeze-frame](Freeze-frame_shot "freeze-frame"){.wikilink}, the [comic
book based on the
film](Creepshow_(comics) "comic book based on the film"){.wikilink} has
the Creep giving a vague hint that Nathan\'s next act was to \"blow out
their candles\".

### \"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\" {#the_lonesome_death_of_jordy_verrill}

```{=mediawiki}
{{see also|Weeds (short story)|l1=Weeds}}
```
Jordy Verrill, a comedic and dim-witted yokel watches as a
[meteorite](meteorite "meteorite"){.wikilink} crash lands on his farm.
Observing the crash site, Jordy gets his fingers burned when he tries to
touch the meteorite. In a fantasy sequence, Jordy imagines selling the
meteorite to the local college\'s \"Department of Meteors\", hoping that
the sale will provide enough money to pay off a \$200 bank loan. Taking
precautions, he douses the meteorite with a bucket of water, causing it
to crack open and spill a glowing blue liquid. In another fantasy
sequence, Jordy reimagines the \"Department of Meteors\" refusing to
purchase the now broken meteorite. Resolving to try and glue the halves
together in the morning, Jordy nonchalantly dumps the liquid inside the
meteor into the soil, but not before the substance makes contact with
his skin.

As time passes, Jordy finds his fingers being overcome by what appears
to be grass. He attempts to call a doctor, but he reconsiders doing so
when he imagines (in another fantasy sequence) that the doctor will chop
the afflicted fingers off without
[anesthetic](anesthetic "anesthetic"){.wikilink}. Over time, the strange
substance continues to grow all over Jordy\'s farm, everything Jordy has
touched, and even on Jordy\'s body, which causes him to itch furiously.
Jordy panics as he discovers the increasing growth, and tries to calm
himself by pouring himself a bottle of [vodka](vodka "vodka"){.wikilink}
and mixing it with [orange
juice](orange_juice "orange juice"){.wikilink}. Soon after, Jordy falls
asleep in a drunken stupor.

Jordy wakes up sometime later, believing the experience to have been a
dream, but his hopes are dashed when he sees that the plant growth has
managed to reach inside the house, as well as discovering in a mirror
that he has now grown a green beard. He starts to draw a bath to relieve
the itching, but he is visited by the ghost of his deceased father, who
appears in his mirror and warns him against doing so by telling him that
water is what the plants want. Grimly rationalizing that not getting in
would only delay the inevitable, Jordy laments that \"\[he\'s\] a goner
already.\" When the itching from the growth on his skin becomes
unbearable, Jordy succumbs to temptation and collapses into the
bathwater.

The next morning, Jordy\'s farm has been completely coated with dense
layers of the [alien](Extraterrestrial_life "alien"){.wikilink}
[vegetation](vegetation "vegetation"){.wikilink}, with Jordy himself
transformed into a human-shaped collection of plant matter. In despair,
he reaches for a [Coach Gun](Coach_gun "Coach Gun"){.wikilink}, prays to
God that his luck will be in just this once, and blows the top of his
head off, killing himself. Immediately afterwards, a TV weather forecast
announces that moderate temperatures and heavy rains are predicted, as
the plants spread down the roads to other towns.

### \"Something to Tide You Over\" {#something_to_tide_you_over}

Richard Vickers is a vicious and heartless
[millionaire](millionaire "millionaire"){.wikilink} whose spry
[jocularity](jocularity "jocularity"){.wikilink} belies his cold-blooded
and murderous nature. He visits Harry Wentworth, the man with whom his
wife Becky is having an [affair](affair "affair"){.wikilink}. Richard
mentions that he and Becky never shared any actual affection, but such
is beside the issue; Richard\'s point of honor is always keeping what\'s
\"his\", a rule that he enforces no matter what. Rather than physically
assault Harry, Richard plays a recording of Becky\'s voice, where she
tearfully begs Harry to help her. Both men travel to Comfort Point,
Richard\'s isolated [beach house](beach_house "beach house"){.wikilink}.
Richard points out what appears to be a burial mound in the sand. When
Harry promptly runs to it, Richard pulls a gun on him. He forces Harry
to jump into the empty hole and begin burying himself.

Eventually, Richard finishes burying Harry neck-deep in the sand below
the high-tide line. Richard then sets up a [closed-circuit TV
camera](closed-circuit_television "closed-circuit TV camera"){.wikilink}
and a [VCR](VCR "VCR"){.wikilink} to record Harry. He also brings along
a monitor displaying Becky, who is also buried up to her neck farther
down the beach, where the rising tide is already washing over her face.
Richard does tell Harry that he and Becky have a chance of survival: if
they can hold their breath long enough for the sand to loosen once the
seawater covers them, they can break free and escape. With that, Richard
abandons Harry and returns to Comfort Point. Sipping a
[cocktail](cocktail "cocktail"){.wikilink}, Richard watches with great
satisfaction as Harry and Becky slowly drown. Just before Harry is
completely submerged by the advancing tide, he looks directly into the
camera and vows revenge on Richard.

Hours later, Richard returns to Harry\'s \"grave\" to collect the tape.
He finds the ruined monitor, but no sign of Harry. Not disturbed,
Richard writes this off as the body having been carried away by the
current. Later that night, Richard hears voices calling his name, as a
mysterious unseen presence easily bypasses Comfort Point\'s extensive
security system. The culprits turn out to be Harry and Becky, the two
lovers having returned as waterlogged,
[seaweed](seaweed "seaweed"){.wikilink}-covered
[revenants](revenant "revenant"){.wikilink} intent on revenge on their
killer. Richard shoots them, but when the bullets have no effect, he
barricades himself in his bedroom, only to find Becky and Harry already
inside. The two victims taunt Richard, who laughs insanely.

Sometime later, the undead lovers have buried Richard up to his neck on
the beach. They have since disappeared together into the surf, leaving
Richard\'s own seaweed-covered video camera to record his coming demise.
As the approaching tide proceeds to drown him, the hysterical Richard
screams that he can hold his breath \"for a LONG time!\"

### \"The Crate\" {#the_crate}

```{=mediawiki}
{{see also|The Crate}}
```
Mike Latimer, a [janitor](janitor "janitor"){.wikilink} at Horlicks
University, drops a quarter he was flipping and it rolls behind a grate
under a basement staircase. While attempting to retrieve the coin, he
comes across a wooden storage crate marked \"Ship to Horlicks University
via Julia Carpenter - [Arctic](Arctic "Arctic"){.wikilink} Expedition -
June 19, 1834\" hidden underneath the staircase. He calls Professor
Dexter Stanley to notify him of the discovery, drawing Dexter away from
a faculty social gathering. Also at the gathering are Dexter\'s best
friend, the mild-mannered Professor Henry Northrup, and Henry\'s
perpetually drunk, obnoxious, and
[emotionally-abusive](Emotionally_abusive "emotionally-abusive"){.wikilink}
wife Wilma \"Billie\", who has a penchant for embarrassing herself,
belittling her husband, and annoying or insulting everybody she meets.
Henry regularly fantasizes about killing his horrific wife, but is far
too timid to actually go through with it.

Stanley meets Mike at Amberson Hall, where the former discovers the
crate. Both men move the crate into a nearby
[biology](biology "biology"){.wikilink} lab, where they tirelessly work
to get it open. In the process, Mike sticks his hand inside the crate
and begins yelling in pain. The crate opens to reveal its contents: a
shaggy, [ape](ape "ape"){.wikilink}-like creature with sharp fangs.
Despite its diminutive size, the creature promptly kills and devours
Mike whole, leaving behind only his mangled boot. Fleeing the lab,
Dexter bumps into graduate student Charlie Gereson, to whom he
frantically relays what happened. While skeptical, Charlie agrees to
investigate the professor\'s claims. The two find the lab covered in
blood, with no sign of the creature or its crate. They discover that the
crate has been moved back under the stairs, where they also discover
Mike\'s boot. Wanting to measure the bite marks on the boot, Charlie
examines the crate closer. The creature pounces on Charlie and kills
him, prompting Dexter to escape and take the boot with him.

Traumatized and hysterical, Dexter runs to Henry\'s house after Billie
leaves for the evening. He tells Henry everything that happened since
the crate was discovered, and insists that the monster must be disposed
of somehow. Seeing the supposed creature as an ideal way to rid himself
of his wife, Henry appears to believe Dexter\'s story. To this end,
Henry spikes Dexter\'s drink with sleeping pills and writes a note
stating that Dexter had supposedly assaulted a female student. This
brings Billie rushing to Amberson Hall, where Henry has since cleaned up
the bloody lab. When Billie arrives, Henry lures her under the basement
stairs, trying to awaken the creature. As Billie rants at Henry for
dragging her out there in the middle of the night and assaulting her,
the beast awakens and proceeds to consume her.

The next morning, Henry tells Dexter that he secured the beast inside
its crate, and then dumped the crate into a nearby
[quarry](quarry "quarry"){.wikilink}, watching as it sank to the bottom.
He convinces Dexter that the creature has drowned, and both men agree to
let the authorities handle the disappearances. Unknown to Henry and
Dexter, the beast is shown to still be alive, and is last seen tearing
the submerged crate apart.

### \"They\'re Creeping Up on You!\" {#theyre_creeping_up_on_you}

Upson Pratt is a ruthlessly cruel [business
mogul](business_mogul "business mogul"){.wikilink} who suffers from
[mysophobia](mysophobia "mysophobia"){.wikilink}, which has rendered him
living in a hermetically sealed [penthouse
apartment](penthouse_apartment "penthouse apartment"){.wikilink}
outfitted with [electric
locks](Electronic_lock "electric locks"){.wikilink} and [surveillance
cameras](surveillance_cameras "surveillance cameras"){.wikilink}. His
apparent contacts with the outside world are through the telephone and
are primarily made to put-upon employees. One stormy night, Pratt
receives a call from George Gendron, one of his subordinates, about the
fact that his company (Pratt International) has recently instigated a
[corporate takeover](corporate_takeover "corporate takeover"){.wikilink}
of the Pacific Aerodyne company. Gendron also informs Mr. Pratt that the
takeover caused a business rival, Norman Castonmeyer, to commit
[suicide](suicide "suicide"){.wikilink}, much to Pratt\'s delight.

During the call, Pratt slowly begins finding
[cockroaches](cockroaches "cockroaches"){.wikilink} around his
apartment. Being a fanatical insect hater, Pratt arms himself with [bug
spray](Insecticide "bug spray"){.wikilink} in an attempt to combat the
insects. Before long, someone manages to get through on Pratt\'s private
line. The caller turns out to be Norman Castonmeyer\'s widow Lenore, who
tearfully recalls her husband\'s final moments and curses Pratt for
causing his death. After finding pieces of cockroaches in his [food
processor](food_processor "food processor"){.wikilink}, Pratt receives a
call from his building\'s superintendent Carl Reynolds, currently on
vacation in [Orlando](Orlando,_Florida "Orlando"){.wikilink}. Despite
his vacation, Pratt forces Reynolds to send the building\'s
[handyman](handyman "handyman"){.wikilink} Mr. White to call an
[exterminator](Pest_control "exterminator"){.wikilink} under the threat
of firing him.

Soon after, Pratt discovers more cockroaches in a box of cereal, trying
and failing to crush any that he can. Mr. White soon arrives outside
Pratt\'s door, and tells him (speaking in a stereotypical
[minstrel](minstrel_show "minstrel"){.wikilink} voice to mock him) that
he is calling a [fumigation](fumigation "fumigation"){.wikilink}
service. A [rolling
blackout](rolling_blackout "rolling blackout"){.wikilink} then heads
towards the building. During the blackout, cockroaches numbering in the
hundreds of thousands begin pouring out of every nook and cranny in
Pratt\'s apartment. As the insects overwhelm Pratt, he activates the
emergency power and attempts to call the police for assistance. The
police are unfortunately unable to be of any help because of the
blackout, nor is Mr. White, who is stuck in the elevator.

At his wit\'s end, Pratt locks himself inside a climate-controlled
[panic room](panic_room "panic room"){.wikilink} to escape the growing
swarm of cockroaches. He gets another call from Lenore, who continues to
curse at him. It\'s during this call that Pratt finds his bedcovers
wriggling, and he removes them to discover that the cockroaches have
already invaded the panic room. With no way for Pratt to escape, the
cockroach swarm charges at him, which induces a [fatal heart
attack](Cardiac_arrest "fatal heart attack"){.wikilink}.

When electricity returns to the building, the apartment is utterly
devoid of cockroaches. Pratt\'s corpse is shown in the panic room as Mr.
White calls in to report. When he gets no answer, Mr. White mockingly
asks Pratt \"Bugs got your tongue?\" Pratt\'s body soon begins to
contort as cockroaches burst out of his mouth and chest, re-enveloping
the panic room. Mr. White continues to call Pratt\'s name to get a
response, then calls him a bastard when he gets no answer.

### Epilogue

The next morning, two garbage collectors find the *Creepshow* comic book
on the curb. They look at the book\'s ads for [X-ray
specs](X-Ray_Specs_(novelty) "X-ray specs"){.wikilink} and a [Charles
Atlas](Charles_Atlas "Charles Atlas"){.wikilink} bodybuilding course.
They also see the advertisement for the [Voodoo
doll](Voodoo_doll "Voodoo doll"){.wikilink} that was briefly glimpsed
earlier, but lament that the order form has already been redeemed.

Inside the Hopkins house, Stan complains to his wife that he is
suffering from a stiff neck, figuring that he must have strained it.
Upstairs, Billy is revealed to have sent away for the voodoo doll, and
has decorated it with a piece of his father\'s clothing and some of his
hair. Stan clutches his throat in [pain](pain "pain"){.wikilink} as
Billy repeatedly and gleefully jabs the voodoo doll with a pin, finally
getting revenge on his father for his abuse.

The images of Billy jabbing the doll becomes the cover of the next issue
of *Creepshow*. The Creep is seen holding the same comic book, laughing
sinisterly as a candle goes out.

## Production

![Several screenshots from the film, demonstrating the way comic-book
imagery and effects were used extensively by director George A. Romero
to recreate the feel of classic 1950s EC horror comics, such as
\'\'[Tales from the
Crypt](Tales_from_the_Crypt_(comics) "Tales from the Crypt"){.wikilink}](Styleexamplescreepshow.jpg "Several screenshots from the film, demonstrating the way comic-book imagery and effects were used extensively by director George A. Romero to recreate the feel of classic 1950s EC horror comics, such as ''Tales from the Crypt"){width="200"}\"Father\'s
Day\", \"Something to Tide You Over\" and \"They\'re Creeping Up on
You!\" are original stories by King written for the film. \"The Lonesome
Death of Jordy Verrill\" is based on King\'s short story
\"[Weeds](Weeds_(short_story) "Weeds"){.wikilink}\" and \"The Crate\" is
based on [the short story of the same
name](The_Crate "the short story of the same name"){.wikilink}.

In keeping with Romero\'s tradition of filming in and around the
Pittsburgh area, most of the film was shot in an empty all-girls school
located outside [Greensburg,
Pennsylvania](Greensburg,_Pennsylvania "Greensburg, Pennsylvania"){.wikilink}.
The school was converted into a film studio, and the episodes \"The
Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\" and \"They\'re Creeping Up on You\",
as well as the prologue and epilogue, were filmed in their entirety at
the former school. Filming took place at the Greensburg location
throughout 1981.[^5]

In a 2015 interview with *[The A.V.
Club](The_A.V._Club "The A.V. Club"){.wikilink}*, Ted Danson explained
the brief shot of his character drowning underwater: \"So they make a
little aquarium tank. I got in a wetsuit and climbed in, and somebody
would reach down with an oxygen tank ventilator thingy, and I\'d
breathe, and then they\'d take that out. And there was a yoke made out
of\... I don\'t know, wood and fake sand, so it looked like my head was
buried in the sand, underwater.\"[^6]

Ray Mendez, an [entomologist](entomologist "entomologist"){.wikilink}
with the [American Museum of Natural
History](American_Museum_of_Natural_History "American Museum of Natural History"){.wikilink},
and David Brody provided 20,000 cockroaches for the segment \"They\'re
Creeping Up on You\".[^7] In the final scene of the segment---in which
the room is almost filled with cockroaches---many of the apparent
insects were actually nuts and raisins, as specified by Tom Savini.[^8]

## Release

*Creepshow* was given a four-week test release in Boston during July
1982 to get a sense of how to market it later on, with the hugely
successful results convincing Warner Bros. that they had a hit on their
hands. It went into wide release on Wednesday, November 10, 1982.[^9] In
its opening weekend, *Creepshow* grossed \$5,870,889 from 1,127
theatres, ranking number 1 at the U.S. box office, replacing *[First
Blood](First_Blood "First Blood"){.wikilink}* in the top spot,[^10] and
had a five-day total of \$8,003,017.[^11][^12] In total it grossed
\$21,028,755 in the United States and Canada,[^13] making it the highest
grossing [horror film](horror_film "horror film"){.wikilink} for Warner
Bros. that year.[^14]

## Reception

[Rotten Tomatoes](Rotten_Tomatoes "Rotten Tomatoes"){.wikilink} gave the
film a 66% approval rating based on 76 reviews; the average rating is
6.3/10. The site\'s consensus reads: \"It\'s uneven, as anthologies
often are, but *Creepshow* is colorful, frequently funny, and treats its
inspirations with infectious reverence.\"[^15] [Roger
Ebert](Roger_Ebert "Roger Ebert"){.wikilink} gave the film three out of
four stars and wrote, \"Romero and King have approached this movie with
humor and affection, as well as with an appreciation of the
macabre\".[^16] In his review for *[The New York
Times](The_New_York_Times "The New York Times"){.wikilink}*, Vincent
Canby wrote, \"The best things about *Creepshow* are its carefully
simulated comic-book tackiness and the gusto with which some good actors
assume silly positions. Horror film purists may object to the levity
even though failed, as a lot of it is\".[^17] Gary Arnold, in his review
for *[The Washington
Post](The_Washington_Post "The Washington Post"){.wikilink}*, wrote,
\"What one confronts in *Creepshow* is five consistently stale,
derivative horror vignettes of various lengths and defects\".[^18] In
his review for *[The Globe and
Mail](The_Globe_and_Mail "The Globe and Mail"){.wikilink}*, [Jay
Scott](Jay_Scott "Jay Scott"){.wikilink} wrote, \"The Romero-King
collaboration has softened both the horror and the cynicism, but not by
enough to betray the sources --- *Creepshow* is almost as funny and as
horrible as the filmmakers would clearly love it to be\".[^19] [David
Ansen](David_Ansen "David Ansen"){.wikilink}, in his review for
*[Newsweek](Newsweek "Newsweek"){.wikilink}*, wrote, \"For anyone over
12 there\'s not much pleasure to be had watching two masters of horror
deliberately working beneath themselves. *Creepshow* is a *faux-naif*
horror film: too arch to be truly scary, too elemental to succeed as
satire\".[^20] In his review for
*[Time](Time_(magazine) "Time"){.wikilink}*, Richard Corliss wrote,
\"But the treatment manages to be both perfunctory and languid; the
jolts can be predicted by any ten-year-old with a stopwatch. Only the
story in which Evil Plutocrat E.G. Marshall is eaten alive by
cockroaches mixes giggles and grue in the right measure\".[^21]

*[Bravo](Bravo_(U.S._TV_network) "Bravo"){.wikilink}* awarded it the
99th spot on their \"The 100 Scariest Movie Moments\", mostly for the
scene with the cockroaches bursting out of Upson Pratt\'s body.[^22]

## Home media {#home_media}

The film was first released in 1983 on [VHS](VHS "VHS"){.wikilink} and
[CED Videodisc](CED_Videodisc "CED Videodisc"){.wikilink}.

In the [United States](United_States "United States"){.wikilink}, Warner
Bros. released a one-disc set on October 26, 1999, with the only extra
feature being the film\'s trailer. No other special features have ever
been released with the Region 1 version. The Region 1 DVD was a
two-sided disc. One side was the 1.85:1 transfer (widescreen) version of
the film and the other side was the full-screen version.

A two-disc Special Edition DVD of *Creepshow* was released on October
22, 2007, in the [UK](United_Kingdom "UK"){.wikilink}. The discs feature
a brand new widescreen transfer of the film sourced from the original
master, a making-of documentary running 90 minutes (titled *Just
Desserts: The Making of Creepshow*), behind-the-scenes footage, rare
[deleted scenes](deleted_scene "deleted scene"){.wikilink}, galleries, a
commentary track with director [George A.
Romero](George_A._Romero "George A. Romero"){.wikilink} and make-up
effects artist, [Tom Savini](Tom_Savini "Tom Savini"){.wikilink}, and
more. The owner of Red Shirt Pictures, Michael Felsher is responsible
for the special edition, the
[documentary](Documentary_film "documentary"){.wikilink} and [audio
commentary](audio_commentary "audio commentary"){.wikilink} in
particular.

On September 8, 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray. Again the only
special feature is the film\'s trailer. [Scream
Factory](Scream_Factory "Scream Factory"){.wikilink} re-released the
film on Blu-ray with new special features (along with most of the ones
from the UK release) on October 23, 2018. This release is sourced from a
brand new 4K scan of the original camera negative, despite the fact
there was some criticism with the 5.1 audio track having been pitched
too high and having sync issues (the included stereo track however has
no issues).[^23]

Second Sight acquired the license to release a new Blu-ray in the United
Kingdom. It contains all of the special features included in the special
two-disc edition which was released in 2007. It also contains a new
audio commentary with Director of Photography Michael Gornick, Actor
John Amplas, Property Master Bruce Alan Green and make-up effects
assistant Darryl Ferrucci.

On June 27, 2023, [Scream
Factory](Shout!_Studios "Scream Factory"){.wikilink} released a [4K
Ultra HD Blu-ray](Ultra_HD_Blu-ray "4K Ultra HD Blu-ray"){.wikilink} of
the film, featurning a \"2023 4K scan of the original camera negative
supervised and approved by director of photography Michael Gornick\" and
new [Dolby Atmos](Dolby_Atmos "Dolby Atmos"){.wikilink} audio track,
together with the 5.1 and stereo tracks included on the 2018 Blu-ray
release.[^24]

## Legacy, sequels, and adaptations {#legacy_sequels_and_adaptations}

The film was adapted into an actual comic book [of the same
name](Creepshow_(comics) "of the same name"){.wikilink} soon after the
film\'s release. [Bernie
Wrightson](Bernie_Wrightson "Bernie Wrightson"){.wikilink}, known for
his work on *[Heavy Metal](Heavy_Metal_(film) "Heavy Metal"){.wikilink}*
and Warren magazines, and fittingly influenced by the 1950s E.C. Comics,
did the artwork and is also the uncredited writer of the comic.[^25]

*[Tales from the
Darkside](Tales_from_the_Darkside "Tales from the Darkside"){.wikilink}*
was the television spin-off. Due to [Warner
Bros.](Warner_Bros._Pictures "Warner Bros."){.wikilink} holding certain
rights including the name Creepshow, the title was changed.

A [sequel](sequel "sequel"){.wikilink}, *[Creepshow
2](Creepshow_2 "Creepshow 2"){.wikilink}*, was released in 1987, and was
once again based on Stephen King short stories, with a screenplay from
*Creepshow* director George A. Romero. The film contained only three
tales of horror (due to budget constraints) as opposed to the
original\'s five stories.

Another sequel, *[Creepshow 3](Creepshow_3 "Creepshow 3"){.wikilink}*,
featuring no involvement from Stephen King, George A. Romero, or anyone
else involved in the production of the first two films, was released
[direct-to-video](direct-to-video "direct-to-video"){.wikilink} in 2007
(though it was finished in 2006) to mostly negative reviews. This film,
in a fashion similar to the original *Creepshow*, features five short,
darkly comedic [horror](Horror_fiction "horror"){.wikilink} stories.

Taurus Entertainment (rights holders of the original *Creepshow*)
licensed the rights to [Jace Hall](Jace_Hall "Jace Hall"){.wikilink}, of
HDFILMS, a Burbank, California company, to produce *Creepshow: RAW*, a
[web series](web_series "web series"){.wikilink} based upon the original
film. The [pilot episode](pilot_episode "pilot episode"){.wikilink} for
*Creepshow: RAW* was wrapped on July 30, 2008. The pilot was directed by
[Wilmer Valderrama](Wilmer_Valderrama "Wilmer Valderrama"){.wikilink}
and features [Michael
Madsen](Michael_Madsen "Michael Madsen"){.wikilink}. No other episodes
have been produced.

Another *[Creepshow](Creepshow_(TV_series) "Creepshow"){.wikilink}*
television series was announced in July 2018, which was produced by
[Greg Nicotero](Greg_Nicotero "Greg Nicotero"){.wikilink} and streamed
on [Shudder](Shudder_(streaming_service) "Shudder"){.wikilink}.[^26]
Each episode of the series consisted of two stories. On January 16,
2019, it was announced that one of the segments of the pilot episode
will be based on Stephen King\'s short story, \"[Survivor
Type](Survivor_Type "Survivor Type"){.wikilink}\" from his 1985
collection, *[Skeleton
Crew](Skeleton_Crew_(short_story_collection) "Skeleton Crew"){.wikilink}*.[^27]
Adrienne Barbeau will return in a new role, and [Tobin
Bell](Tobin_Bell "Tobin Bell"){.wikilink} will contribute a role.[^28]
On July 19, 2019, it was announced that the series will premiere on
September 26, 2019.[^29] The series spawned a tie-in novel from
Scholastic Books entitled *Creepshow: The Taker*, featuring two novellas
inspired from the show.[^30] A follow-up novel is scheduled for release
in April 2021, entitled *Creepshow: The Cursed*, also featuring two
novellas inspired by the show.[^31] On October 30, 2019, the series was
renewed for a second season, which premiered on April 1, 2021. On
February 18, 2021, the series was renewed for a third season.

On August 3, 2019, [Universal Destinations &
Experiences](Universal_Destinations_&_Experiences "Universal Destinations & Experiences"){.wikilink}
announced that *Creepshow* would be coming to [Halloween Horror
Nights](Halloween_Horror_Nights "Halloween Horror Nights"){.wikilink}
exclusively at its [Universal Studios
Hollywood](Universal_Studios_Hollywood "Universal Studios Hollywood"){.wikilink}
theme park. The maze featured three segments from the 1982 movie as well
as two others from the newly made web television version for
Shudder.[^32]
